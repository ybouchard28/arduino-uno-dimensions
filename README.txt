====================================================================

This is a CAD model of the Arduino UNO board dimensions.

The repository contains two files, namely the CAD design source file and the technical drawing file:

	arduino-uno-dimensions-source.FCStd
	arduino-uno-dimensions-drawing.pdf

The CAD model was designed with FreeCAD 0.21.2.

I hope theses files will help you in your Arduino UNO projects!
